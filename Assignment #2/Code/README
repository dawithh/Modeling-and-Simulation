There is a makefile that will compile my simulation into an executable called "sim". My code is in the file "mm2.c". My input for
problem 2 is titled "mm2.in1" and its output is "mm2.out1". The tweaked inputs for problem 3a are in the file "mm2.in2" and the 
output of that simulation is in "mm2.out2". My written responses are in a separate folder.
